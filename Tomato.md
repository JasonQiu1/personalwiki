The number one culinary vegetable under the heavens.

The depth of flavor tomatoes impart on other ingredients is unparalleled. It brings everything -- meats, vegetables, carbs -- to a higher level in any style of cooking:  stir-frying, braising, souping, stewing, dipping, roasting, salading. Probably the only thing that tomatoes could not work with is deep-frying, but I've never tried it, so who knows.
