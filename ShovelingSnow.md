I shoveled snow for 5 hours today from noon (4 hours not including food breaks) and damn is it rough. 

My snow shovel was about 2-3 feet long, and I was digging out a massive driveway.

The first 3 hours were easy enough, I had a system figured out where I
shovelled out the snow in the perimeter of the concrete and then a bit outside of the concrete for the next step. 

After that, I could alternate between shoveling snow near the edges and "rolling" to the edge snow that was near the center.

By roll, I mean placing the shovel against the ground and scaping it towards the snow. 

Rolling is a lot less time-efficient than shoveling but it is much easier for center snow, since center snow would take much more energy to throw out.

Shoveling was very intensive but rolling was not, so I would shovel until I was tired and then roll until I was ready to shovel again.

However, rolling does not work for snow higher than say, 12 inches, so I still ended up shovelling a large portion out.

After 3 hours was when the exhaustion really kicked in, but fortunately my dad brought me some sandwiches then, and I had already eaten a banana and ice cream bar during earlier breaks.

I had already finished about 60% of the driveway, but it was on average more shallow compared to the unfinished part.

I wanted to finish in one more hour, so I ended up abandoning form (keep back relatively straight, and fling snow with legs and arms), especially when it came to the 2 feet high center snow.

I finished up, somewhat proud of my work, and immediately felt my entire body ache when I got home a couple hours ago at time of writing.

Tomorrow will feel worse, physically, after I wake up, but maybe I can feel better mentally if I sleep tonight thinking about that awesome paved driveway.
