A common pattern I absolutely detest when reading books (particularly [[Webnovels]]).

Maybe this is a result of editors wanting the content to get across more clearly to help lost readers, fear by authors that their painfully crafted ideas are being misunderstood, or a necessary measure by webnovel authors to reach word count quotas.

No matter the reason, personally when I read this pattern, I go ape shit. 

It feels insulting when you experience the joy of, say, figuring out the mystery from in between the lines, only for the author to then write "oh and the solution to the mystery is whatiliterallyjustwroteanddidntneedtotell."

It's as if you were working on a puzzle and couldn't figure it out no matter what, so you ask someone who has solved it for some hints. 

They silently point out a couple of random places and leave you to it. 

You have no idea what they mean, but as you look at those places more and more, an idea begins forming in your head. 

You fall deep into thought as that idea continues growing and growing, until "BAZING-" -- the puzzle maker busts down the door and yells in your ear, "THOSE PIECES ARE ACTUALLY CONNECTED BECAUSE THE COLORS AND SHAPES AND CIPHER CODE POKEMON..."

You see how unsatisfying and infuriating that can be? It's not even in the same league as someone spoiling a movie you haven't watched -- at least it wasn't the director themself who spoiled it for you.

That is not to say that concepts shouldn't be written more clearly or that they should be written as vague as possible so the reader has to think about one line for 10 hours before being able to proceed. 

My point is that explicitly telling a point after it was already masterfully *shown* to the reader is a horrible way to make a concept more clear and self-sabotages the hard work put into what was written before.
