A classic home-style stirfry dish you can eat any time of day .

In my opinion, the focus of the dish is more on the delectable [[Tomato|tomato]] sauce, and the light, fluffy eggs act as substance to make the sauce shine.

Serve with [[SteamedRice|rice]] and other dishes or in a [[Sandwich|sandwich]]. 

Or just make the sauce without eggs and serve on rice or toast. Or sub the scrambled stir-fried eggs with a sunny side up or over-easy. Doesn't matter, sauce is good.

Ingredients:
- equal volume egg to tomato.
- (optional) some green onion.
- around 1/4 teaspoon of sugar per 2 eggs
- around a tablespoon of olive oil per 3 eggs

Preparation:
- Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them while adding a pinch of salt and/or msg for each egg.
- Slice the tomatoes in half and cut out the root/stem thing.
- Slice the tomato halves into around 1cm slices and set aside.
- (optional) Slice the green onion to whatever length you like, whether thin like ribbons or an inch long.

Instructions:
- Warm up on high a nonstick pan or pot with enough surface area for all the tomato slices.
- Once hot enough to sizzle drops of water, add the oil and spread around.
- Add the beaten eggs and spread around. Push the eggs from edge to center if there is a lot of liquid.
- Just as most of the eggs are set and are no longer liquid, turn the heat down to medium push them to one side.
- Add the sliced tomatoes flesh-side down as best you can and put the eggs on top of the tomatoes. 
- (optional) If you are adding long green onion slices, add them on top of the eggs here.
- Put the lid on and wait until the tomatoes are soft. The eggs may start puffing up due to the steam, that's intentional.
- When the tomatoes are soft, turn the heat to low and take off the lid.
- Move the eggs on top aside again and squash the tomatoes into pulp carefully
- Once the tomatoes are pretty much sauce, add the sugar into the sauce and mix evenly with the eggs. You can add some msg too if you want.
- While mixing, you can make the chunks of egg as big or small as you'd like. 
- (optional) If you are adding very short green onion slices, add them here.
- Done!
