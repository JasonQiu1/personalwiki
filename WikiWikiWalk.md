The name and essence of what this personal wiki is all about.

I thought for 5 minutes on what I wanted this wiki to be for me. I definitely wanted it to start with WikiWiki -- to pay homage to the wiki greats like [c2](https://wiki.c2.com) and [Everything Shii Knows](https://shii.bibanon.org/shii.org/knows/Everything_Shii_Knows.html)-- but Web and World didn't really click with me.

Why did c2 choose Web and Shii choose World anyways?

c2's focus is on patterns in software development, existed in a time the World Wide Web had just come out of infancy, and has many hands touching its interconnected pages, so Web makes sense.

Shii's focus is... well, everything Shii knows -- their world -- so World makes sense.

I'm not a particularly ambitious person. I don't think I could build a web as dense and thought-provoking as the Web or create an impressionistic far-reaching world.

## A Walk
So I want this wiki to be a walk, gazing at the meadows by the path, the ivory clouds drifting through the sky, the dots and ripples across the waters, and maybe even the smooth and rugged path itself.

I want to take a walk, sometimes short, sometimes long, jotting down what I see and learn. Sometimes I'll be strolling, other times retracking, wandering, camping, or anything in between.

I want to rewalk the paths I've tread before and find that weird rock I missed, a strange pattern I wasn't conscious of, or the faint croaking of frogs accompanied by a leisurely stream I was deaf to before. 

I want each page to be a walk with dozens more walks branching out from them and take a new walk when I get too comfortable.

After I've walked enough and stop for a bit, I want to wave and jump and holler, sharing with myself the great things I've witnessed and how I've changed. 

This wiki is a walk, and the first step is here.
